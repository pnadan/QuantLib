Changes for QuantLib 1.12.1:
============================

QuantLib 1.12.1 is a bug-fix release for version 1.12.

It fixes an error that would occur during initialization of the
test suite when using the newly released Boost 1.67.0 (see
<https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib/pull/446> for details).
Thanks to Klaus Spanderen for the prompt fix.

The library code is unchanged from version 1.12.
